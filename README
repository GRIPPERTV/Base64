Made by fun because I don't wanted to be lazy and use any Base64 library out there,
but I learned how bitwise works and how to exploit then to do some cool bit-stuff.

This is a simple Base64 with only char support, all functions inside can be used
in compile time, and faster than the most Base64 I benchmarked. Even if it's only
have char support, you can use it with string creating a new char, enconding, and
then creating a new string with the value of char.

No license because Base64 projects are very simple and don't need to be monopolized.
