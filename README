Made by fun because I don't wanted to be lazy and use any Base64 library out there,
but I learned how bitwise works and how to exploit then to do some cool bit-stuff.

With only char support, functions in compile time, error handling in the caller
side (you need to check the errors) and one of the fastests Base64 I benchmarked.

You can encode strings too with the data function (https://t.ly/VP40).
For example:
  std::string Hey("", 4);
  Base64::Encode3Bytes((char*)Hey.data(), "Hey", 3);

For Base64 url encoding just define BASE64_URL.

No license because Base64 projects are very simple and don't need to be monopolized.
